# iOS prepared package

[English](PREPARED_INPUT.md) | [简体中文](PREPARED_INPUT.zh-CN.md)

Supply an HTTPS link to a ZIP, tar.gz, or tar.xz package in the `prepared_input` workflow parameter. The required files are shown below; one enclosing directory is supported.

```text
prepared.json
source-payload.zip
shader-chain.lock
resource-manifest.json
romfs-inputs.zip
legacy/
  pack.json
  pack_index.tsv
generated/host/
  dm_vault_tab.h
  dm_hud_exp.h
  dm_bright_levels.inc
```

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `prepared.json` | Format `d2r-mobile-prepared`, schema `2`, game versions, program checksums, payload metadata and each file’s size and SHA-256. `producer.source_commit` identifies the source used to generate the package. |
| `source-payload.zip` | Rewritten game program, loader tables and precompiled iOS Metal libraries under `Payload/DmIOS.app/`. |
| `shader-chain.lock` | Shader toolchain fingerprints. |
| `resource-manifest.json` | Names and sizes of the 18 Data files for this game resource version, shared by iOS and macOS. |
| `romfs-inputs.zip` | Selected original layouts, strings, images, fonts, tables and CASC metadata needed by upstream resource generators. |
| `legacy/` | Existing Legacy texture-pack descriptor and index. |
| `generated/host/` | Game-table headers, reused when their generator scripts are unchanged. |

Interface assets, layouts, strings and overlays follow the selected source. Matching generated outputs are cached and reused across native-code changes. Game-table headers are reused when their generator scripts are unchanged; modified generators rebuild their tables. Game programs and Metal libraries are reused while their generation rules remain compatible. If those heavy generation rules change, generate a new prepared package.

The workflow downloads this package and compiles the selected source into two IPAs. Download Data and the Legacy Device Pack separately from your resource provider, then follow the [installation instructions](../README.md#download-and-use-on-ios).

## Generate an iOS prepared package

In your private repository, configure two Secrets. Each contains a JSON object with an HTTPS download `url` and `sha256`:

| Secret | Input |
|---|---|
| `GAME_ARCHIVE` | An archive containing one `ExeFS` / `RomFS` pair; the same original input used for Mac preparation |
| `LEGACY_METADATA` | A ZIP containing `pack.json` and `pack_index.tsv` from the Legacy pack generation output for the same game resource version |

Save the following as `.github/workflows/prepare-ios-input.yml`, then run **Actions → Prepare iOS input → Run workflow**:

```yaml
name: Prepare iOS input
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      source_repository:
        description: Source repository
        type: string
        default: jhaizhou-ops/d2r-mobile
      source_ref:
        description: Branch, tag or commit; empty selects the latest release
        type: string
        default: ''
permissions:
  contents: write
  actions: write
jobs:
  prepare:
    uses: jiayx/d2r-mobile-build/.github/workflows/prepare-ios.yml@main
    with:
      source_repository: ${{ inputs.source_repository }}
      source_ref: ${{ inputs.source_ref }}
    secrets:
      GAME_ARCHIVE: ${{ secrets.GAME_ARCHIVE }}
      LEGACY_METADATA: ${{ secrets.LEGACY_METADATA }}
      SOURCE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SOURCE_TOKEN }}
```

The workflow defaults to the latest official upstream Release. It prepares rewritten game programs, precompiled iOS Metal libraries and the small original inputs needed to generate interface resources. The existing Legacy index is included for older-device overlays.

The original game archive and completed preparation outputs are cached by their inputs and generation dependencies. The workflow publishes `D2RMobile-Prepared.zip` and `Prepared-SHA256SUMS.txt` to your private Releases. Set the ZIP’s URL and checksum in your `prepared_input` JSON, then use **Build IPA** for ordinary builds.
